This document introduces how to complete the preparatory work before integrating payment features in the development environment, helping you verify functions and ensure normal integration operation.

**Next steps:**
After completing development environment verification, when you are ready to deploy payment features to the production environment, refer to [Preparation for production environment](/v2/payments/preparation-prod) for related guidance.


## Prerequisites

* [Contact our sales team](https://www.cobo.com/book-demo?utm_source=product-manual&utm_medium=product&utm_campaign=pricing-plan-intro&utm_content=enterprise-contact-sales) to obtain your account activation link.

* An iOS device for running [Cobo Guard](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/guard/introduction), which is our dedicated application for multi-factor authentication (MFA), operation approval, transaction signing, and key share management.

## Basic preparation

### Create account and set up Cobo Guard
As the first admin of your team, please use the activation link provided by our sales team to create your Cobo Portal development environment account. After creation, please follow these steps to set up Cobo Guard:

1. Log in to Cobo Portal [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).
2. Click **Guide** in the lower left corner, then click **Bind Cobo Guard**.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Cobo Guard on your iOS device and associate your account with Cobo Guard.

### Invite members
1. Log in to Cobo Portal [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).
2. Click the profile icon in the lower left corner, then click **Organization**.
3. Click **Members**. On the **Members** page, click **Invite Member**.
4. Enter the member's email address and name, then select the appropriate [user role](/v2/payments/roles-and-permissions).
<Note>Please confirm on Cobo Guard that this invitation was initiated by you. Additionally, according to the default governance policies, at least half of the team admins need to approve the invitation request on Cobo Guard.</Note>

   After receiving the invitation, new members should create their own accounts and set up Cobo Guard as described in the previous section.

### Install Payments App

Payments App provides a web interface that allows you to conveniently perform daily operations such as payment collection queries, fund management, and payouts. Installation steps are as follows:

1. Log in to Cobo Portal [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).

2. On the homepage, click the **Payments** card.
<img src="/en/images/payments/install-payment-app.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Payments App Intro" />

3. Click the **Install** button and follow the on-page instructions to complete installation. For **Wallet scope**, select **Any wallet type**.

4. If the page prompts that admin approval is needed, please notify the admin to approve on Cobo Guard. After approval, the App will automatically complete installation.

## Technical configuration

### Payments API calling preparation

If you need to call Payments API, you need to follow these steps to complete API key configuration.

1. Refer to the [Developer guide](/v2/guides/get-started/get-started-with-waas) to generate an API key and API secret pair, and register the API key in Cobo Portal. Please note the following configurations:
   * **User role**: Select **Payment admin**
   * **Wallet scope**: Select **Any wallet type**
   * No need to configure callback endpoint in the development environment. In the production environment, you can configure a callback endpoint to approve payout requests.
   * **Key type**: Select **Temporary**

2. If you choose to use an SDK instead of manually writing API requests, you need to install the SDK for the corresponding programming language:
   - [Python SDK quickstart](/v2/developer-tools/quickstart-python)
   - [Java SDK quickstart](/v2/developer-tools/quickstart-java) 
   - [Go SDK quickstart](/v2/developer-tools/quickstart-go)
   - [JavaScript SDK quickstart](/v2/developer-tools/quickstart-javascript)

### Subscribe to webhook events

If you need to receive real-time notifications of payment-related events, you can set up and register a webhook endpoint to receive webhook events. Specific steps are as follows:

* Refer to the [Developer guide](/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/set-up-endpoint) to set up a webhook endpoint.  
* [Register the webhook endpoint](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/developer-console/webhooks-create) in Cobo Portal and subscribe to [payment-related webhook events](/v2/payments/status-and-events).

### (Optional) Configure callback endpoint

To provide additional security for your funds, you can configure a callback endpoint to approve payout requests. After configuration, when a fiat payout or cryptocurrency transfer occurs, Cobo will send a request containing complete transaction information to your callback endpoint. The transaction will only proceed after your callback endpoint returns a response to approve it.
* Refer to the [Developer guide](/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/set-up-endpoint) to set up a callback endpoint and implement the processing logic.  
* [Register the callback endpoint](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/developer-console/callbacks-register) in Cobo Portal.


## Business configuration


<a id="merchants"></a>
### Create merchant


You can create merchants using either the Payments App or Payments API.

- If you directly serve payers, you can use the **default merchant** automatically created by the system (with the same name as your organization). If you want to manage funds separately for different business lines, you can also create multiple merchants.
- If you are a platform serving multiple downstream merchants, it is recommended to create multiple merchants and configure dedicated developer fee rates for each merchant to achieve automatic fund splitting and settlement.
- For more information about merchant management use cases and descriptions, please refer to [Merchant management](/v2/payments/merchants).


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Payments App" icon="pager">
  1. Log in to Cobo Portal [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).
  2. In the left navigation bar, click **Apps**, then click the **Payments** card to launch the App.
  3. In the App's left navigation bar, click **Merchants**.
  4. Click the **Create Merchant** button.
  5. Complete the following configurations in the popup:
     - Enter the merchant name.
     - If you choose to use top-up or subscription mode, you can also set a **Developer fee rate**. The developer fee rate determines the percentage of each payment you receive as a developer. For example, setting it to 1% means 1% of each payment will be allocated to you as a developer fee. You can adjust the developer fee rate at any time after creating the merchant. For more details about developer fee rates and fund allocation, please refer to [Funds allocation and balances](/v2/payments/amounts-and-balances).

If your subsequent operations involve API calls, you can click the **View Detail** button after creation to obtain and save the merchant ID. You will need to use the merchant ID to identify this merchant in subsequent API calls.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Payments API" icon="code">

1. Call [Create merchant](/v2/api-references/payment/create-merchant) to create a merchant, passing the following information in the request:  
   * `name`: Merchant name
   * `wallet_setup`: (Optional) Wallet setup. Each wallet contains multiple cryptocurrency addresses that serve as the merchant's receiving addresses. Based on your business needs, you can choose from the following two wallet setups:
       - **Shared** (default): Multiple merchants share the same wallet. The wallet's addresses may be used to receive payments for multiple merchants simultaneously.
       - **Separate**: Create a dedicated wallet for the merchant to achieve complete fund isolation. All addresses in this wallet are only used to receive payments for this merchant.
   * `developer_fee_rate`: (Optional) If you choose to use top-up or subscription mode, you can also set a developer fee rate. The developer fee rate determines the percentage of each payment you receive as a developer. For example, setting it to 1% means 1% of each payment will be allocated to you as a developer fee. You can adjust the developer fee rate at any time after creating the merchant. For more details about developer fee rates and fund allocation, please refer to [Funds allocation and balances](/v2/payments/amounts-and-balances).


   After the call, you will receive a merchant ID (`merchant_id`), which serves as the unique identifier for this merchant in the Cobo system and is used to identify the merchant in subsequent API calls.

### Top up Fee Station

During your daily business operations, you need to manage various fees incurred on Cobo through [Fee Station](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/fee-station/introduction). Before you start integration, please ensure that you have sufficient funds in your Fee Station to pay for fees generated during payouts, refunds, and other processes:

- You can use USDT or USDC as the fee token
- The recommended initial top-up amount is equivalent to approximately 50 USD in cryptocurrency. You can adjust the top-up amount based on actual business needs.

For specific top-up operation steps, refer to the [Top up Fee Station](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/fee-station/deposit) document.

## Next steps

Refer to the [Feature list](/v2/payments/features#payment-collection) to select the pay-in type suitable for you and refer to the documentation to complete payment collection feature integration.
