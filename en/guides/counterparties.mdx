When using top-up mode for receiving payments, you can use the **Counterparties** feature to manage payer information.


After registering counterparties (either individuals or organizations) and their wallet addresses, the counterparty name corresponding to the source address will be displayed in top-up transactions, helping you identify the source of funds in a timely manner.
