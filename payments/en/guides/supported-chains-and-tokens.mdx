## Overview

This document helps you understand which tokens, chains, and currencies are supported for different payment scenarios:

- **Payment collection**: Accept stablecoin payments from your customers
- **Pricing**: Set prices in familiar fiat currencies
- **Off-Ramp**: Convert stablecoins to fiat currency

<Note>
The tokens listed in this document are specifically supported for Cobo Payment. While Cobo Portal supports a broader range of tokens, only the stablecoins listed below will be automatically credited when received. Other tokens sent to Payment addresses will not be automatically processed.
</Note>

## Supported tokens and chains for payment collection

The stablecoins and chain combinations that can be received during payment collection are as follows:

| | Arbitrum | ARBITRUM_USDCOIN | 32 | 0.05 USDC | ETH |
| | Base | BASE_USDC | 100 | 0.05 USDC | ETH |
| | Polygon | MATIC_USDC2 | 128 | 0.05 USDC | MATIC |
| | BNB Smart Chain | BSC_USDC | 15 | 0.05 USDC | BNB |
| | Solana | SOL_USDC | 1 | 0.05 USDC | SOL |

### How to choose the right chain

| Priority | Recommended Chains | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Lowest fees | BNB Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Base | Layer 2 or low-cost networks |
| Widest compatibility | Ethereum | Most widely supported |
| Off-Ramp ready (no bridging fee) | Ethereum (ETH_USDC, ETH_USDT), TRON (TRON_USDT) | No additional bridging fees required |

## <a name="pricing-currency"></a>Supported pricing currencies

When creating a payment order, you can use the following fiat currencies as the pricing currency (`pricing_currency`). The system will automatically calculate the payable amount based on the real-time exchange rate of the currency.

Exchange rates are updated every 10 minutes. You can query the current exchange rate using the [Get exchange rate](/payments/en/api-references/payment/get-exchange-rate) operation.

<Note>
You can only specify the following currencies as pricing currencies during payment collection. After cryptocurrencies are deposited, if you need to perform Off-Ramp operations, only USD is supported for conversion.

## Off-Ramp support

The following table lists the supported token and chain combinations for Off-Ramp operations. For example, you can convert BASE_USDC to fiat currency through Off-Ramp in the production environment, but bridging fees are required.

| Token and Chain | Development Environment | Production Environment |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| ETH_USDC | Supported | Supported |
| ARBITRUM_USDCOIN | Not supported | Supported (bridging fee required) |
| BASE_USDC | Not supported | Supported (bridging fee required) |
| MATIC_USDC2 | Not supported | Supported (bridging fee required) |
| BSC_USDC | Not supported | Supported (bridging fee required) |
| SOL_USDC | Not supported | Supported (bridging fee required) |
| AVALANCHE_C_USDC | Not supported | Not supported |
| TRON_USDT | Supported | Supported |
| ETH_USDT | Supported | Supported |
| ARBITRUM_USDT | Not supported | Supported (bridging fee required) |
| BASE_USDT | Not supported | Not supported |
| MATIC_USDT | Supported (bridging fee required) | Supported (bridging fee required) |
| BSC_USDT | Supported (bridging fee required) | Supported (bridging fee required) |
| SOL_USDT | Not supported | Supported (bridging fee required) |
| TON_USDT | Not supported | Not supported |
| AVALANCHE_C_USDT | Not supported | Not supported |
| TTRON_USDT | Supported | Not supported |

<Info>Token and chain combinations marked as "bridging fee required" incur additional bridging fees on top of regular fees when performing Off-Ramp operations.</Info>

## Testing

You can use testnet tokens to verify your integration before going live. Testnet transactions do not involve real funds.

| Token | Testnet | Token ID | Contract Address | Faucet |
|-------|---------|----------|------------------|--------|
| USDT | TRON Nile | TTRON_USDT1 | `TXYZopYRdj2D9XRtbG411XZZ3kM5VkAeBf` | [Get test tokens](https://nileex.io/join/getJoinPage) |

<Note>
Currently, only TRON Nile testnet is supported for testing. More testnets may be added in the future.
</Note>

## Important notes

<Warning>
**Always verify the network before sending**

Sending tokens on the wrong network may result in permanent loss of funds. For example:
- Sending USDC on Polygon to an Ethereum address will not be credited
- Each Token ID corresponds to a specific chain — always match them exactly

If you or your customer accidentally sends tokens on an unsupported network, contact [Cobo Support](https://support.cobo.com) with the transaction hash for assistance.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Token ID usage**

When integrating with the Cobo API, always use the exact Token ID (such as `ETH_USDC` or `TRON_USDT`) as specified in this document. Using incorrect Token IDs will result in API errors.
</Note>
