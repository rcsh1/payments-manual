## 2. Complete secondary confirmation, risk control review, and transaction signing

After creating a transfer request, based on your submission method, risk control settings, and other factors, you need to complete the following operations:

- Secondary confirmation: If you transfer through Payments App, you need to confirm the transfer request on Cobo Guard.
- Risk control review: If you have set transaction policies, reviewers may need to approve the transfer request on Cobo Guard.
- Transaction signing: If you are using MPC Wallets, Mobile Co-Signer or Server Co-Signer needs to sign to finally complete the transfer operation.

## 3. Follow up on transfer status

You can subscribe to the `payment.settlement.status.updated` event to receive real-time updates on transfer status. Refer to [Webhook reference](/payments/en/guides/status-and-events) to understand the detailed trigger conditions and returned data structure of each event.

You can also actively query transfer request status through Payments App or Payments API.
