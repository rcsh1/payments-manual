This document introduces how to transfer the cryptocurrency you received to an external cryptocurrency address.


## 1. Create crypto payout request

You can create crypto payout requests through Payments App or Payments API.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Payments App" icon="pager">
1. Log in to Cobo Portal [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login) or [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. In the left navigation bar, click **Apps**, then click the **Payments** card to launch the App.
3. In the App's left navigation bar, click **Funds Management** > **Payouts**.
4. You can choose to withdraw from **Merchant balance** or **Developer balance**. In this example, we choose to withdraw from the merchant balance. Click the **Settle** button on the **Merchant balance** card.
5. In the pop-up window, select **Crypto Payouts**. The pay-in type can be **Order** or **Top-up**, corresponding to order mode and top-up mode payment balances respectively.
6. Fill in the transfer information, including token and network, related orders or amount, and receiving address.<Note>If you have enabled the **Use Destinations as Payout Whitelist** toggle in **Destinations**, you can only transfer to registered destinations. For more details, see [Destinations](/payments/en/guides/destinations)</Note>
7. Follow the on-page prompts to confirm and submit the transfer request.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Payments API" icon="code">

  1. Before creating a transfer request, you can call [List merchant balances](/payments/en/api-references/payment/list-merchant-balances) or [Get developer balance](/payments/en/api-references/payment/get-developer-balance) to query merchant and developer balances respectively, to determine the maximum transferable amount.
  2. Call [Create crypto address](/payments/en/api-references/payment/create-crypto-address) to register the cryptocurrency address for transfer. Record the `crypto_address_id` field for later use in specifying the transfer destination address.
  3. Call [Create settlement request](/payments/en/api-references/payment/create-settlement-request) to create a transfer request.

**Basic parameters**
* `request_id`: The unique request ID you provide to track the transfer request
* `acquiring_type`: Pay-in type. Can be set to `Order` or `TopUp`, corresponding to order mode and top-up mode payment balances respectively
* `settlement_type`: Set to `Merchant` or `Psp`, corresponding to merchant balance and developer balance respectively
* `payout_channel`: Set to `Crypto` for crypto payouts

**Detail parameters (`settlements` array)**

Depending on the source of funds, you need to specify different parameter combinations.

| Fund source | Related parameters |
|---------|---------|
| **Merchant balance** |  `merchant_id`, `order_ids`, `token_id`, `crypto_address_id` |
| **Developer balance** | `amount`, `token_id`, `crypto_address_id` |

**Parameter description:**
- `merchant_id`: Merchant ID. Multiple merchants can be specified through the `settlements` array
- `order_ids`: Order ID list. If this parameter is empty, all eligible orders will be selected and the cryptocurrency amount for this transfer will be automatically calculated.
- `amount`: Cryptocurrency amount
- `token_id`: Cryptocurrency ID (such as `ETH_USDT`, `TRON_USDT`)
- `crypto_address_id`: Unique identifier for the destination cryptocurrency address. You can obtain this ID in the following ways:
  - Call [Create crypto address](/payments/en/api-references/payment/create-crypto-address) to register a new transfer address
  - Call [List crypto addresses](/payments/en/api-references/payment/list-crypto-addresses) to query the list of registered addresses
</Tab>
</Tabs>


## 2. Complete secondary confirmation, risk control review, and transaction signing

After creating a transfer request, based on your submission method, risk control settings, and other factors, you need to complete the following operations:

- Secondary confirmation: If you transfer through Payments App, you need to confirm the transfer request on Cobo Guard.
- Risk control review: If you have set transaction policies, reviewers may need to approve the transfer request on Cobo Guard.
- Transaction signing: If you are using MPC Wallets, Mobile Co-Signer or Server Co-Signer needs to sign to finally complete the transfer operation.


## 3. Follow up on transfer status
You can subscribe to the `payment.settlement.status.updated` event to receive real-time updates on transfer status. Refer to [Webhook reference](/payments/en/guides/status-and-events) to understand the detailed trigger conditions and returned data structure of each event.

You can also actively query transfer request status through Payments App or Payments API.
