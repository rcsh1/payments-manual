This document introduces how to transfer the cryptocurrency you received to an external cryptocurrency address.

## 1. Create crypto payout request

You can create crypto payout requests through Payments App or Payments API.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Payments App">
    1. Log in to Cobo Portal [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login) or [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
    2. In the left navigation bar, click **Apps**, then click the **Payments** card to launch the App.
    3. In the App's left navigation bar, click **Funds Management** \> **Payouts**.
    4. You can choose to withdraw from **Merchant balance** or **Developer balance**. In this example, we choose to withdraw from the merchant balance. Click the **Payout** button on the **Merchant Balance** card.
    5. In the pop-up window, select **Crypto Payout**.

         className="screenshot_full_screen"
         alt="Crypto payout entry"
       />
    6. Fill in the transfer information, including token, network, merchant name, amount, and receiving address.

       <Note>
         If you have enabled the **Use Destinations as Payout Whitelist** toggle in **Destinations**, you can only transfer to registered destinations. For more details, see [Destinations](/payments/en/guides/destinations)
       </Note>
    7. **Auto-Select Sources**:
       - When enabled, you only need to enter the **total payout amount**, and the system automatically allocates the payout across available token balances in your wallet.
       - When disabled, you must manually specify the payout amount for each token. This option is enabled by default and can be turned off if needed.
    8. **Cross-chain payout**:
       
       When paying out **USDT or USDC on a specific network**, the system can use **USDT or USDC balances on other networks** in your wallet and bridge them before payout.

       Currently, only **same-asset cross-chain payouts** are supported. Cross-asset conversion is not supported.
       
       1. **Fees**:
          
          Same-asset cross-chain payouts incur a processing fee, which is automatically calculated based on the payout amount.
       
       2. **Example**:
          
          Available balances in the source account:
          - 150 USDT (Tron)
          - 50 USDT (Ethereum)
          
          If the total payout amount is **200 USDT (Tron)**, the system will bridge **50 USDT (Ethereum)**.
          
          With a cross-chain fee of **10 USDT (Ethereum)**, the estimated amount received will be **190 USDT (Tron)**.
    9. Follow the on-page prompts to confirm and submit the transfer request.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Payments API">
    1. Before creating a transfer request, you can call [List merchant balances](/payments/en/api-references/payment/list-merchant-balances) or [Get developer balance](/payments/en/api-references/payment/get-developer-balance) to query merchant and developer balances respectively, to determine the maximum transferable amount.
    2. Call [Create Payout](/payments/en/api-references/payment/create-payout) to create a transfer request.

    **Basic parameters**

    - `request_id`: The unique request ID you provide to track the transfer request
    - `source_account`: Payment source account. When withdrawing funds from a merchant account, pass the merchant_id; when withdrawing funds from a developer account, set to `developer`.
    - `payout_channel`: Set to `Crypto` for crypto payouts

    **Detail parameters (payout_params & recipient_info)**

    | Schema             | Related parameters   |
    | :----------------- | :------------------- |
    | **payout_params**  | `amount`, `token_id`  |
    | **recipient_info** | `token_id`, `address` |

    **Parameter description:**

    - `amount`: Cryptocurrency amount
    - `token_id`: Cryptocurrency ID (such as `ETH_USDT`, `TRON_USDT`). When the `token_id` in **payout_params** and **recipient_info** have the same tokens but different chains, Cobo will automatically execute a cross-chain operation.
    - `address`: Target cryptocurrency address
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 2. Complete secondary confirmation, risk control review, and transaction signing

After creating a transfer request, based on your submission method, risk control settings, and other factors, you need to complete the following operations:

- Secondary confirmation: If you transfer through Payments App, you need to confirm the transfer request on Cobo Guard.
- Risk control review: If you have set transaction policies, reviewers may need to approve the transfer request on Cobo Guard.
- Transaction signing: If you are using MPC Wallets, Mobile Co-Signer or Server Co-Signer needs to sign to finally complete the transfer operation.

## 3. Follow up on transfer status

You can subscribe to the `payment.settlement.status.updated` event to receive real-time updates on transfer status. Refer to [Webhook reference](/payments/en/guides/status-and-events) to understand the detailed trigger conditions and returned data structure of each event.

You can also actively query transfer request status through Payments App or Payments API.
