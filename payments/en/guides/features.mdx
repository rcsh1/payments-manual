## Core business features

### Pay-ins
- Provides flexible and diverse pay-in modes, supporting various scenarios such as fixed/unfixed amounts, timed/untimed payments, and one-time/recurring deductions:
  - [Top-up mode](/payments/en/guides/get-topup-addresses): Generate dedicated top-up addresses for each payer, allowing them to top up any amount at any time.
    - [Counterparties management](/payments/en/guides/counterparties): When using top-up mode for payment collection, you can register commonly used payers' wallet addresses. After registration, top-up transaction records will display the payer names corresponding to the source addresses, helping you quickly identify fund sources.
  - [Order mode](/payments/en/guides/create-orders): Create payment orders with a specified amount and validity period, requiring payers to complete payment within the specified time. Supports order cancellation, refunds, and handling abnormal situations such as overpayment, underpayment, and late payment.
    - [Payment links](/payments/en/guides/payment-link): When using order mode for payment collection, if you want to save development time for building custom payment pages, you can directly use Cobo's payment links as payment pages or embed them into your website or application via iFrame.
  - [Subscription mode](/payments/en/guides/create-subscriptions): Periodic, automatic deductions through smart contracts and other methods.
- [Refund links](/payments/en/guides/create-refund-link): When end users need refunds for various reasons, you can generate a refund link for them to fill in their refund addresses, and Cobo will automatically complete the refund process.
- [Supported chains and tokens](/payments/en/guides/supported-chains-and-tokens): Cobo payments solution supports multiple mainstream stablecoins such as USDC and USDT, and can be used on multiple mainstream chains.

### Merchant management
If you are a payment service provider (PSP), e-commerce platform, or other institution that needs to provide services for multiple downstream merchants, you can use the merchant management module to independently settle revenue for each merchant and configure developer fee rates to achieve automated revenue sharing with merchants. For details, see [Merchant management](/payments/en/guides/merchants) and [Accounts and fund allocation](/payments/en/guides/amounts-and-balances).

### Fund management

- Accounts and fund allocation: The system maintains **developer accounts** and **merchant accounts** for you to record and manage fund ownership for each party. After payment is completed, the system automatically allocates funds to corresponding accounts based on the developer fee rates you configured; you can also manually transfer funds between accounts as needed. For details, see [Accounts and fund allocation](/payments/en/guides/amounts-and-balances) and [Allocate funds](/payments/en/guides/allocate-funds).
- Earn/DeFi: If you want to invest idle funds to generate returns, you can use Cobo's [Earn App](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/earn/introduction) to purchase stable funds management products or invest idle funds into different DeFi protocols.

### Payouts

- [Off-ramp](/payments/en/guides/fiat-payouts): Convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency and transfer it to your bank account through OTC vendors.
- [Crypto payouts](/payments/en/guides/crypto-payouts): Transfer cryptocurrency to external wallet addresses through on-chain transfers.
- Automatic bridging: Automatic bridging is supported when you initiate off-ramp or crypto payouts. For example, you can simultaneously transfer USDT on both TRON and Ethereum chains to a TRON wallet address, and the system will automatically bridge the Ethereum USDT to TRON and transfer it to the target wallet address.
- [Destination management](/payments/en/guides/destinations): Centrally manage payout destination information, including cryptocurrency wallet addresses and bank accounts. Supports setting the destination list as a whitelist to flexibly control the range of transferable addresses, improving security and operational efficiency.


### Compliance and risk control

You can use the [Screening App](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/screening/introduction) to perform compliance screening on received funds to ensure transaction security and compliance.


## Developer integration

### API integration
Through Payments API, you can fully integrate payment collection, fund management, payouts, and other features into your system. We provide SDKs in multiple programming languages to simplify the development process:

- SDK quick start guides: [Python](/payments/en/developer-tools/quickstart-python) | [JavaScript](/payments/en/developer-tools/quickstart-javascript) | [Java](/payments/en/developer-tools/quickstart-java) | [Go](/payments/en/developer-tools/quickstart-go)

### Event notifications
By configuring Webhook endpoints, you can receive real-time event notifications, including order status changes, top-up arrivals, payout completions, and more.
- [Webhook introduction](/payments/en/developer-tools/webhook): Learn about webhook mechanisms and signature verification
- [Events and statuses](/payments/en/guides/status-and-events): View the complete list of events and status descriptions

## Operations management

### Roles and permissions

Cobo payments solution provides fine-grained role and permission management, supporting assignment of different roles to different members to achieve separation of permissions and approval process control. For details, see [Roles and permissions](/payments/en/guides/roles-and-permissions).


### Fee management
In your daily business operations, you need to manage various fees incurred on Cobo through Fee Station. For specific deposit procedures, please refer to the [Deposit to Fee Station](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/fee-station/deposit) documentation.

### Reports and analytics
