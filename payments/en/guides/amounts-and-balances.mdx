Cobo maintains revenue and expenditure records for two types of funds: **merchant funds** and **developer funds**. **Merchant** represents the actual business entity receiving payments, while **developer** represents the entity providing payment collection services (that is, you). All payment collection needs to specify the merchant to which it belongs, and determines the revenue share that the developer should receive through developer fees/rates.

By creating merchants and setting developer fees/rates, you can achieve automated fund settlement and revenue sharing:

- If you serve payers directly:
  - Usually, you only need to create one merchant (use the merchant created by default by the system), and no need to configure a developer fee rate.
  - If you want to manage funds separately for different business lines, you can create a merchant for each business line.
- If you are a platform institution serving multiple downstream merchants, you can create a merchant in the system for each downstream merchant and achieve automated merchant settlement and platform revenue allocation by setting developer fees/rates.

For more information on usage scenarios and descriptions of merchant management, refer to [Merchant management](/payments/en/guides/merchants).

## Amount allocation rules

In different pay-in types and refund scenarios, the collection method and calculation rules for developer fees differ. The following will detail the fund allocation mechanism in various scenarios.


### Top-up mode

In top-up mode, fund allocation is based on the developer fee rate (`developer_fee_rate`) set when creating the merchant. The developer fee rate determines the proportion the developer receives in each top-up.

**Example**: When the developer fee rate is 1%, a 100 USDT top-up will be allocated as 99 USDT merchant funds and 1 USDT developer fee.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '12px'}}}%%
graph TD
    A[Developer fee rate: 1%] --> B[Payer top-up<br/>100 USDT]
    
    B --> C[Merchant actual receipt<br/>99 USDT]
    B --> D[Developer fee<br/>1 USDT]

    C --> E[Merchant balance increases<br/>99 USDT]
    D --> F[Developer balance increases<br/>1 USDT]

    style C fill:#c8e6c9
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#c8e6c9
    style F fill:#fff3e0
```



### Order mode

In order mode, fund allocation is based on the amount parameters set when creating the order. The ratio between the developer fee (`fee_amount`) and the product order amount (`order_amount`) determines the proportion the developer receives in each order.

**Example**: When the product order amount is 99 USDT and the developer fee is 1 USDT, the actual received amount of 100 USDT from the order will be allocated as 99 USDT merchant actual receipt and 1 USDT developer fee:
```mermaid
%%{init: {'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '12px'}}}%%
graph TD
    A[Product order amount 99 USDT<br/>Developer fee 1 USDT] --> B[Payer payment<br/>100 USDT]
    
    B --> C[Merchant actual receipt<br/>99 USDT]
    B --> D[Developer fee<br/>1 USDT]
    
    C --> E[Merchant balance increases<br/>99 USDT]
    D --> F[Developer balance increases<br/>1 USDT]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#c8e6c9
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#c8e6c9
    style F fill:#fff3e0
```



<Note>
Special case handling:

- Overpayment/Underpayment: Allocate funds according to the same ratio as above
- Late payment: All funds are recorded as developer fee
</Note>

### Refunds

The source of the refund amount can be either the merchant balance or the developer balance.

 - When the refund amount comes from the merchant balance, you can specify the developer fee amount. For example, when the refund amount (`payable_amount`) is 100 USDT and the developer fee (`merchant_fee_amount`) is 1 USDT, 1 USDT from the 100 USDT refund amount will be allocated as the developer fee, and the payer will actually receive 99 USDT.
- When the refund amount comes from the developer balance, the developer fee field will be ignored, and the full refund amount will be deducted from the developer balance and transferred to the payer.


The following diagram shows the allocation and flow of funds during the refund process (sample data):

```mermaid
%%{init: {'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '12px'}}}%%

    F -->|Refund from developer balance| E2[Create refund order<br/>Refund amount: 100 USDT]
    
    E1 --> G[Deduct 100 USDT from merchant balance]
    E2 --> H[Deduct 100 USDT from developer balance]
    
    G --> J[Payer actually receives<br/>99 USDT]
    G --> K[Developer balance increases<br/>1 USDT]
    
    H --> L[Transfer to payer<br/>100 USDT]

### Merchant balance

**Merchant balance** refers to the total amount of funds that a merchant can withdraw or refund at a specific moment. Calculation formula:

`Merchant balance = Total merchant actual receipt - Withdrawn merchant funds - Merchant funds used for refunds`


This balance can be queried through the **Balance** module of Payments App or by calling [List merchant balances](/payments/en/api-references/payment/list-merchant-balances).


### Developer balance

**Developer balance** refers to the total amount of funds that the developer can withdraw or refund at a specific moment. Calculation formula:


`Developer balance = Total developer fees - Withdrawn developer funds - Developer funds used for refunds`

<Info>In addition to developer fees in various pay-in types, the total developer fees also include funds transferred from external wallets.</Info>

This balance can be queried through the **Balance** module of Payments App or by calling [Get developer balance](/payments/en/api-references/payment/get-developer-balance).
