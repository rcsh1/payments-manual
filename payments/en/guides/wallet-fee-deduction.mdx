When end users transfer using cryptocurrency wallets, different network fee (gas fee) handling methods will affect the actual amount received. This document introduces the fee deduction methods of mainstream wallets to help you understand situations that may lead to underpayment.

## Fee deduction methods

Cryptocurrency wallet fee deduction methods are mainly divided into two types:

- **External deduction**: Network fees are not deducted from the transfer amount, and the transfer amount remains unchanged. For example, when transferring 100 USDT, the payer needs to pay gas fees additionally, and the payee receives the full 100 USDT.

- **Internal deduction**: Network fees are deducted from the transfer amount, resulting in the payee actually receiving less than the transfer amount. For example, when transferring 100 USDT with a gas fee of 2 USDT, the payee actually only receives 98 USDT.


When payers use internal fee deduction for transfers, if they use the order's payable amount directly as the transfer amount without considering that gas fees will be deducted from it, underpayment will occur.

## Recommendations

To ensure accurate payment amounts, we recommend:

1. Remind payers to be aware of internal deduction issues to ensure accurate payment amounts.
2. Set reasonable order amount tolerance to allow underpayment within a certain range to handle possible internal fee deduction situations.
