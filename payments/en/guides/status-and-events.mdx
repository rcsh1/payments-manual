## Tips

To ensure absolute data accuracy and avoid concurrency conflicts, the Webhook payload does not include real-time balance changes or detailed fee deductions. If your use case requires this information, please refer to the following:

- **To update balances promptly based on Webhook notifications:** Upon receiving a Webhook, immediately call the [List merchant balances](/payments/en/api-references/payment/list-merchant-balances) or [Get developer balances](/payments/en/api-references/payment/get-developer-balance) endpoint to obtain the accurate balance for internal accounting.
- **To obtain fee details associated with a transaction for reconciliation:** Use the corresponding transaction query endpoints or [Generate reports](/payments/en/api-references/payment/generate-reports) to retrieve fee reports for data verification.
- **To monitor Fee Station balance changes and prevent business disruption:** Periodically call [List Fee Station token balance](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/feestation/list-fee-station-token-balances) and set up internal alerting based on your consumption rate to avoid service interruptions due to insufficient fees.
