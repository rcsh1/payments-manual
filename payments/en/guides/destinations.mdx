The **Destinations** feature is used to centrally manage payout destination information, including wallet addresses for receiving cryptocurrency and bank accounts for off-ramp.

- For off-ramp, you need to register a bank account with a name that matches your company's legal entity name, and it must be approved by Cobo's operations team before it can be used for payouts.

- For crypto payouts, you can flexibly manage the allowed transfer addresses through the **Use Destinations as Payout Whitelist** toggle:
  - If enabled, transfers are only allowed to registered destinations (wallet addresses);
  - If disabled, you can freely enter destination addresses or select from registered destinations.

## Add a destination

You can add destinations in the Payments App.

### Permission requirements

Only **Payment Admin** and **Admin** roles have permissions to create, edit, and delete destinations. **Payment Member** has view-only access and cannot make modifications.

### Steps

1. Log in to Cobo Portal [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login) or [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. In the left navigation bar, click **Apps**, then click the **Payments** card to launch the App.
3. In the App's left navigation bar, click **Funds Management** > **Destinations**.
4. Click the **Add Destination** button in the upper right corner.
5. In the pop-up form, fill in the wallet address and/or bank account information to be registered.

   - If registering a wallet address, you can optionally associate it with a specific merchant. Once associated, the system will automatically select this wallet address as the destination when initiating payouts for that merchant, improving operational convenience and accuracy.
   - When adding a bank account, ensure the account name matches your company's legal entity name.
6. Click **Submit** and complete the identity verification.
7. If you registered a bank account, you need to wait for approval from Cobo's operations team before using it for payouts.
