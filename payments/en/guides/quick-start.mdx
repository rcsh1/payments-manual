## PSP integration example

As a payment service provider (PSP), you need to provide payment collection services for multiple merchants and achieve automated revenue sharing. A typical integration process is as follows:

  1. Development environment setup: Complete [Prerequisites](/payments/en/guides/preparation) (create account, configure API Key and Webhook Endpoint, deposit to Fee Station)

  2. Merchant management and fund configuration: [Create merchants](/payments/en/guides/merchants) for each downstream merchant to achieve independent revenue and expense management.

  3. Integrate payment collection: Collect payments through [Order mode](/payments/en/guides/create-orders).
  
     - When creating orders, set developer fees to achieve automated revenue sharing with merchants.
     - (Optional) Use [Payment links](/payments/en/guides/payment-link) to quickly build payment pages for merchants.
 
  4. Fund management: Use the [Allocate funds](/payments/en/guides/allocate-funds) feature to adjust allocation between accounts (such as collecting developer fees or handling overpayment, underpayment, late payment, and other abnormal situations).

  5. Payouts: Supports [Off-ramp](/payments/en/guides/fiat-payouts) and [Crypto payouts](/payments/en/guides/crypto-payouts). Off-ramp requires pre-configuring bank accounts in [Destinations](/payments/en/guides/destinations).

  6. Production environment launch: After testing is complete, refer to [Production environment preparation](/payments/en/guides/preparation-prod) to complete configuration and go live

## Gaming platform integration example

As a gaming platform, you directly serve end-user players, with the main revenue source being player top-ups. A typical integration process is as follows:

  1. Development environment setup: Complete [Prerequisites](/payments/en/guides/preparation) (create account, configure API Key and Webhook Endpoint, deposit to Fee Station)

  2. Merchant configuration: **No need to create new merchants**, just use the default merchant automatically created by the system (same name as your Cobo Portal team).

  3. Integrate payment collection: Collect payments through [Top-up mode](/payments/en/guides/get-topup-addresses)
  
     - Create a dedicated top-up address for each player
     - Players use fixed addresses to top up, and the system automatically associates top-up records with the corresponding payer
     - Query each payer's top-up details through Payments App or API

  4. Payouts: Supports [Off-ramp](/payments/en/guides/fiat-payouts) and [Crypto payouts](/payments/en/guides/crypto-payouts). Off-ramp requires pre-configuring bank accounts in [Destinations](/payments/en/guides/destinations).

  5. Production environment launch: After testing is complete, refer to [Production environment preparation](/payments/en/guides/preparation-prod) to complete configuration and go live
