# Changelog Skill

## Overview
This skill helps create and improve professional changelogs that clearly communicate release updates. It transforms raw commit messages, rough notes, or draft changelogs into well-structured, user-friendly documentation following semantic versioning and changelog best practices.

## Capabilities
- **Structure Organization**: Organize changes into standard categories (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security) following Keep a Changelog conventions.
- **User-Friendly Language**: Rewrite technical commit messages and jargon into clear descriptions focused on user impact.
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent formatting, tone, action verbs, and style throughout all entries.
- **Semantic Versioning Alignment**: Verify changelog reflects semantic versioning principles (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Breaking changes warrant MAJOR version bumps.
- **Breaking Change Clarity**: Clearly highlight breaking changes with migration guidance and upgrade paths.
- **Impact Communication**: Help users understand what changes affect them (performance, security, functionality, dependencies).
- **Grouping & Prioritization**: Group related changes logically. Prioritize important changes (security fixes, breaking changes) appropriately.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Output clean, well-formatted Markdown with proper heading hierarchy and consistent styling.
- **Version Dating**: Include version release dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for clarity.

## Usage
Provide commit messages, release notes, PRDs, or existing changelog content. The skill will transform it into a professional changelog following best practices. You can specify target format, release date, and any special focus areas.

## Well-Written Examples

While the repositories don't contain traditional changelog files, they demonstrate excellent practices for documenting changes:

### Key Best Practices Found in Existing Documentation

1. **Security-Focused Communication** - `/developer-site-waas2/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/`
   - ✅ Breaking changes clearly marked and explained
   - ✅ Migration guidance provided for each change
   - ✅ Security implications highlighted
   - ✅ Numbered, structured format for clarity

2. **Feature Explanation with Context** - `/payments-manual/payments/en/guides/`
   - ✅ Features introduced with "what" and "why"
   - ✅ Related operations/endpoints always linked
   - ✅ User benefits emphasized, not implementation details
   - ✅ Breaking changes explicitly documented in prerequisites sections

3. **Version-Specific Documentation** - `/developer-site-waas2/v2/guides/overview/changelog.mdx`
   - ✅ Version markers in documentation
   - ✅ Migration guides between versions
   - ✅ Deprecation notices with clear timelines
   - ✅ SDK version requirements documented

### Good Documentation Practices to Apply to Changelogs:

- **Use clear action verbs** - "Added", "Fixed", "Removed", "Improved" (see /v2 guides examples)
- **Link to related documentation** - Like guides do with cross-references
- **Organize by feature category** - Not by implementation (see Payments Manual guide organization)
- **Mark breaking changes clearly** - With explicit notices (see /v2 server-co-signer guides for security/breaking change patterns)
- **Provide migration paths** - Link to migration guides or alternative approaches
- **Include version numbers** - Always specify SDK or API version (SDK v1.30.0 format)

### Example Interactions

**Input**: A list of commit messages:
```
- Fixed wallet creation bug when user has no permissions
- Added batch export feature
- Improved API response times by 40%
- Removed deprecated OAuth flow
- Updated SDK dependencies
```
**Output**:
```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2024-01-15

### Added
- Batch export feature for large transaction datasets

### Changed
- Improved API response times by 40% through database optimization

### Fixed
- Wallet creation now properly validates user permissions before creating wallet

### Removed
- Deprecated OAuth 1.0 flow (migrate to OAuth 2.0 by 2024-03-01)

### Security
- Updated SDK dependencies to address potential vulnerabilities
```

**Input**: "Our v2.0 is a complete rewrite with a new API structure"
**Output**:
```markdown
## [2.0.0] - 2024-01-20 - BREAKING CHANGES

This is a major release with significant breaking changes. **Please review the migration guide before upgrading.**

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: API endpoint structure changed from `/api/v1/wallets` to `/wallets/v2`
- **BREAKING**: Response format changed from XML to JSON
- **BREAKING**: Authentication method changed from Basic Auth to Bearer tokens (see [migration guide](/guides/auth-v2))
- Improved error messages with detailed troubleshooting information
- Enhanced webhook payloads with additional context

### Added
- New WebSocket API for real-time updates
- Batch operations support for improved performance
- Advanced filtering and sorting on list endpoints

### Removed
- XML response format (use JSON instead)
- Basic authentication (use Bearer tokens or OAuth 2.0)
```

## Quality Criteria

A high-quality changelog entry should have:

1. **Clear Category**: Entry belongs in exactly one logical category (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
2. **Action Verb**: Starts with past tense verb (Added, Fixed, Changed, Improved, Removed, etc.)
3. **User Impact**: Describes what users need to know or do, not implementation details
   - ✅ "Added batch export for large datasets"
   - ❌ "Updated export function to handle arrays"
4. **Specificity**: Enough detail that users understand the change
   - ✅ "Fixed wallet creation failing when user lacks admin permissions"
   - ❌ "Fixed wallet bug"
5. **No Jargon**: Avoids overly technical terms or links to internal systems
6. **Completeness**: Important context included (affected features, workarounds, related links)
7. **Consistency**: Matches style of other entries (tense, verb form, detail level)
8. **Breaking Change Clarity**: Explicitly marked with "BREAKING:" prefix if upgrade path needed

## Guidelines

**All changelog entries must follow Cobo's standard terminology and language rules.**

Refer to the **Reference Materials** skill for:
- [General Writing Rules](../reference-materials/SKILL.md#general-writing-rules) (spelling, grammar, formatting)
- [Standard Terminology & Glossary](../reference-materials/SKILL.md#standard-terminology--glossary) (product names, payment terminology)
- [Word Choice Rules](../reference-materials/SKILL.md#word-choice-rules) (specific words and usage)
- [Quick Reference for transformations](../reference-materials/SKILL.md#quick-reference-common-transformations) (internal → user-facing language)

### Core Guidelines

- **User-Centric**: What do end-users and developers need to know? Focus on impact, not implementation.
- **Action Verbs**: Use past tense, clear verbs
  - ✅ Added, Changed, Improved, Fixed, Removed, Deprecated, Updated, Enhanced, Resolved
  - ❌ "Did", "Made", "Worked on", "Tweaked"
- **Clarity Over Completeness**: Be concise but specific. Each entry should stand alone and be understandable.
- **Breaking Changes**:
  - Always prefix with "BREAKING:" or include in a dedicated section
  - Include migration path or link to migration guide
  - Use version heading to make it obvious (e.g., "## [2.0.0] - MAJOR RELEASE")
- **No Technical Jargon**: Avoid: "Refactored authentication module" → Use: "Improved authentication response times"
- **Consistency Rules**:
  - Use past tense consistently (Fixed, not Fix)
  - Use parallel structure: "Added X, Changed Y, Removed Z" (not "Added X, Y is removed")
  - Apply consistent detail level across similar changes
  - Use American spelling, no contractions
- **Terminology**: Use standard Cobo terminology (see Reference Materials)
  - "Payment collection" (not "deposits")
  - "Payouts" (not "withdrawals")
  - "Compliance screening" (not "security check")
- **Grouped by Category**: Organize strictly by category type:
  - **Added**: New features, endpoints, fields
  - **Changed**: Modifications to existing functionality, improvements, enhancements
  - **Deprecated**: Features marked for future removal with timeline
  - **Removed**: Features or code that are gone (especially after deprecation period)
  - **Fixed**: Bug fixes
  - **Security**: Security improvements, vulnerability fixes, CVE patches
- **Chronological Within Category**: List changes newest to oldest within each category (optional if only one release)
- **Version Format**: Use semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-prerelease][+build]
  - 1.0.0 (first release), 1.1.0 (feature), 1.0.1 (bug fix), 2.0.0 (breaking changes)
- **Date Format**: Always use ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Link References**: Include links where helpful
  - Link to migration guides for breaking changes
  - Link to related issue/PR numbers where helpful
  - Use descriptive link text
- **Deprecated Items**: When marking something as deprecated, include:
  - What is being deprecated
  - Why (if not obvious)
  - What to use instead
  - Timeline for removal (if known)
  - Link to migration guide

## Common Changelog Categories

- **Added**: New features, endpoints, parameters, integrations
- **Changed**: Improvements, enhancements, modifications to existing functionality
- **Deprecated**: Features marked for future removal with deprecation timeline
- **Removed**: Features, endpoints, or code that is no longer available
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes and corrections
- **Security**: Security vulnerabilities, patches, improvements

## 11. COBO-SPECIFIC PATTERNS

### Organizing by Feature Category (Not Implementation)

**CRITICAL:** Organize changelog by user-visible features, NOT by implementation details.

✅ **Feature Categories**:
- 收款 (Payment collection)
- 资金转出 (Payouts)
- Webhook 事件 (Webhook events)
- 资金管理 (Fund management)
- 支付链接 (Payment links)
- 合规筛查 (Compliance screening)
- SDK & Tools

❌ **Implementation Details (Remove)**:
- "App端/API端" (App vs API - combine into feature)
- "状态机调整" (State machine refactoring)
- "重构新接口" (Interface refactoring)
- "上线相关交付物" (Delivery artifacts)
- Internal refactoring or optimization details

### Example: Cobo Payments Changelog Format

```

### Key Transformation Principles

1. **Focus on User Benefits**
   - ❌ "重构新接口"
   - ✅ "转出流程更加高效，无需区分资金来源"

2. **Group by Feature, Not Implementation**
   - ❌ App vs API
   - ✅ Combine into one entry about the feature

3. **Include All Affected APIs**
   - List all new/changed operations with links
   - Mark deprecated operations explicitly

4. **Document Breaking Changes Clearly**
   - Use table with "BREAKING:" prefix
   - Include migration guidance
   - Link to migration guides when available

5. **Specify SDK Version**
   - Always include: `(SDK v1.30.0)`
   - Ask if missing: "Which SDK version?"

6. **Remove Internal Deliverables**
   - ❌ "用户引导手册" (user guide)
   - ❌ "developer hub"
   - ✅ Only include user-visible features

### Questions to Ask When Creating Changelogs

- [ ] What is the SDK version? (e.g., v1.30.0)
- [ ] What is the release date? (Format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] What is the main feature category?
- [ ] What are ALL affected API endpoints? (List with links)
- [ ] Are any features deprecated? (List all with migration path)
- [ ] Are there any breaking changes? (Mark clearly with BREAKING:)
- [ ] What is the user benefit/value proposition?
- [ ] Should this be organized differently (by feature vs category)?

### Handling Missing Information

Don't guess - ask specifically:

```
❓ Which SDK version is required?
- [ ] SDK v1.30.0
- [ ] SDK v1.31.0
- [ ] Multiple versions
- [ ] Not applicable
- [ ] Other: ___________
```

Use placeholders in output when information is unclear:

```markdown
| **资金管理** | (SDK v[VERSION]) [需要确认：功能描述] |  |
```
